# RulloFX
RulloFX is a mental calculation game. <br>
For each row and column, you will need to get the correct amount of points on the squares. To do this, you only need to delete all the circles that should not enter the calculation in your opinion. If you get the right total in all the rows and all the columns, you have won!
